# dz-qb-handsup

This script replaces the original `handsup.lua` from [qb-smallresources](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-smallresources). In this version, the player will have to hold `X` down to keep their hands up. The animation is also slowed down so it looks more realistic. 

## Installation
- Download the script and put it in the `[qb]` directory.
- Remove the `handsup.lua` script from [qb-smallresources](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-smallresources/blob/main/client/handsup.lua).
- Restart the server or start the resource from the server console.
